# Parallel State Machine Replication (SMR)


This package contains the source code that implements a parallel SMR based on BFT-SMaRt (src/), binary file (dist/), libraries needed (lib/), running script (p_smartrun.sh) and configuration files (config/).

Since this library was buint over BFT-SMaRt, most of the configurations are the same used by that system. See the BFT-SMaRt page for more details (link).
