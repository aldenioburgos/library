# Parallel State Machine Replication (SMR)


This package contains the source code that implements a parallel SMR based on BFT-SMaRt (src/), binary file (dist/), libraries needed (lib/), running script (p_smartrun.sh) and configuration files (config/). For a detailed explanation about how to configure the system, please take a look at the BFT-SMaRt github page (https://github.com/bft-smart/library).
